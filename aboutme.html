                <p>I'm Patrick Fleckenstein. I received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical
                    Engineering from San Diego State University in 2020. I've enjoyed all aspects
                    of mechanical engineering, but have a special interest in engineering
                    mechanics and design. I also enjoy some coding, mainly in Python.
                    <br><br>
                    As for other revelant hobbies, I enjoy FDM 3D printing and designing parts for
                    3D printing. I also like to work with microcontrollers, such as an Arduino or ESP32,
                    in addition to basic circuitry and electrical connections.
                    <br><br>
                    I designed this website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and published it using GitHub Pages.
